I am Mónica, a Colombian who moved abroad to find her way and to get to know other cultures. This is how my life has been enriched by people, languages, beautiful experiences, and plenty of learnings.

I have lived in different cities: in **Montevideo**, Uruguay (2009). In 2010, I moved to Brazil. I lived in **Rio de Janeiro** for almost 7 years. Rio was my home, a city that gave me the habit of running, the love for the Portuguese language, invaluable friendships, a Ph.D. degree in materials science, and much, much more. I enjoyed the amazing and vibrant sunsets at Pedra do Arpoador (super recommended). I still feel Rio inside me.
In 2016, I also lived in **Lisbon** for 6 months. I enjoyed its famous Pastel de Belem (sweet with flaky dough and creamy vanilla filling) and its beautiful sunsets at Mirador de la Señora del Monte.
Since 2018, I have been living and working in **Luxembourg**, a small country in the heart of Europe.

Professionally speaking, I am an Engineer in Physics. I hold an M.Sc. and a D.Sc. in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science.
After finishing my doctoral studies, I moved to the computer science field, specifically to the cybersecurity and cryptography areas. I completed a second master's degree in Information and Computer Science at the University of Luxembourg.

I am extremely curious about new technologies, ideas, and cultures. Having the opportunity of working in different fields, allows me to approach projects from different perspectives.
